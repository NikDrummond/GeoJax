# GeoJax

**GeoJax** is a fast, JAX-powered geometry and statistics toolkit for scientific computing, robotics, and ML pipelines. It provides efficient, differentiable routines for vector operations, alignment, projection, rotations, circular statistics, outlier detection, and more — all accelerated with [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

## Features

- ✅ Vector algebra, projection, reflection, affine transforms
- ✅ Coordinate alignment via PCA and Gram-Schmidt
- ✅ Rotation matrices from vectors or axis-angles
- ✅ Circular statistics: mean, std, variance (radians & degrees)
- ✅ Mahalanobis distance and outlier detection
- ✅ Bounding shapes: AABB, bounding sphere, OBB
- ✅ Geometric predicates: unit, orthogonal, collinear
- ✅ Fully JIT-compiled with typed inputs via JAX

## Installation

Install GeoJax and JAX (CPU backend by default):

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install "jax[cpu]"
```

Or with CUDA (if using an NVIDEA GPU):

```bash
pip install "jax[cuda11]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

## Quick Start

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from GeoJax import *

# Rotate a vector
v = jnp.array([1.0, 0.0, 0.0])
axis = jnp.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0])
v_rotated = rotate_around_axis(v, axis, jnp.pi / 2)

# Detect outliers
X = jnp.array([[1, 2], [1.1, 2.1], [0.9, 1.9], [50, 80]])
outliers = detect_outliers_mahalanobis(X, alpha=0.99)

# Circular mean of radians
angles = jnp.array([0.0, jnp.pi / 2, jnp.pi])
mean_angle = circmean(angles)
```
