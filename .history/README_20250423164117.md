# GeoJax

**GeoJax** is a fast, JAX-powered geometry and statistics toolkit for scientific computing, robotics, and ML pipelines. It provides efficient, differentiable routines for vector operations, alignment, projection, rotations, circular statistics, outlier detection, and more — all accelerated with [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Vector algebra, projection, reflection, affine transforms
- ✅ Coordinate alignment via PCA and Gram-Schmidt
- ✅ Rotation matrices from vectors or axis-angles
- ✅ Circular statistics: mean, std, variance (radians & degrees)
- ✅ Mahalanobis distance and outlier detection
- ✅ Bounding shapes: AABB, bounding sphere, OBB
- ✅ Geometric predicates: unit, orthogonal, collinear
- ✅ Fully JIT-compiled with typed inputs via JAX
